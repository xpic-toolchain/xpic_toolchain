### xpic implementation:
  xpic is a subversion of avr 
  xpic assembler with jmp relocation (R_XPIC_24_PCREL)
  xpic disassembler (objdump works properly)
  simple linker script is constructed in "work/test4_xpic_jmp_2src"

### in binutils project:
  clean       - script to remove all backup files (somefile~)
  clean_cache - script to remove all 'config.cache' files from project to reconfigure
!!./configiure --target=xpic-elf32 - don't works properly. It will be fixed in future
